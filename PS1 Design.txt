Problem 1 
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment 
required by the credit card company each month. Use raw_input() to ask for the following three floating point numbers: 
1. the outstanding balance on the credit card 
2. annual interest rate 
3. minimum monthly payment rate For each month, print the minimum monthly payment, remaining balance, principle paid
in the format shown in the test cases below. All numbers should be rounded to the nearest penny. 
Finally, print the result, which should include the total amount paid that year and the remaining balance.
